<!-- ### About Markdown

Markdown is an easy-to-use plain text formatting syntax created by John Gruber.

To write a text in Markdown you need a Markdown editor. Fortunately VS Code comes with an easy-to-use Markdown editor. Hence, open a markdown file (.md file) in VS code and press ``preview`` in the upper right corner and you will see the Markdown code side-by-side with a view showing the rendered text.

To get started using Markdown we suggest that you open the file you are currently reading (ProjectTemplate.md), or (better) [this file](https://homepage.lnu.se//staff/jlnmsi/python/2021/Macdown.zip), in a Markdown editor and compare the rendered result with the given markdown code. Then Google various markdown tutorials to understand markdown symbols that are not obvious from the given examples. A few examples:

Python code markup:

```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		return a
	else:
		return b
```

Inserting images (using HTML markup):

<img src="http://homepage.lnu.se/staff/jlnmsi/python/2020/cos_sin.png" width="400"/>


This is a table with left- , center-, and right-allgned columns:

| Left Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
|:------------- |:---------------:| -------------:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text |         $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |           $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |            $1 |

The left- and right-most pipes (`|`) are only aesthetic, and can be omitted. The spaces donâ€™t matter, either. Alignment depends solely on `:` marks in the lines under the column titles. -->

<!-- ## Regarding the report template

The template below is in English. Feel free to write your report in Swedish or English. 

We expect each team to present their report as their README.md in the Gitlab repository.

Try to be short and precise. We expect more than 2000, but less than 4000, words. 

Assume that the reader knows about Python. Give a reference and explain techniques introduced that we havn't presented in the course.

In what follow we give you the **mandatory report headlines** and brief comments about what we expect each section to contain. Make sure to remove our comments (and the Markdown intro above) in your final report.

# Mini-project report 
**Members:** Liam Cosford  
**Program:** Network Security  
**Course:** 1DV501  
**Start of the project:** 2022-10-17  
**Date of submission:** 2022-11-06

## Introduction  
<!-- A brief introduction including a presentation of the project tasks. Present the project as a part of the course 1DV501.   -->

This is the report which will explain how I have solved the tasks that follow below. As part of my Network security course.  
- [Count unique words 1](#part-1-count-unique-words-1)
  - Code examples
- [Implementing data structures](#part-2-implementing-data-structures)
  - BNS (Binary Search Tree/s)
  - Hash/ing
- [Count unique words 2](#part-3-count-unique-words-2)
  - Code examples

Then to end is my [conclusion](#project-conclusions-and-lessons-learned) and breakdown of what problems and issues I have faced, along with what I have learnd.

<br>

## Part 1: Count unique words 1
<!-- The text should include: -->
<!-- - How many words did each of the two text files  -->
<!-- ``life_of_brian`` and ``swedish_news_2020`` have? -->
<!-- - How did you implement the Top-10 part of the problem. Feel free to show code fragments. -->
<!-- - Present a unique word count and the Top-10 lists for each of the two files. -->

<!-- Each file had [brian_13393_words.txt](../assignment-03/data/brian_13393_words.txt) and [swe_news_15226315_words.txt](../assignment-03/data/swe_news_15226315_words.txt) words respectivly -->

| Top 10 words life_of_biran  |   | Top 10 words swe_news |
|:- 			  			  |:-:|				        -:|
| sample txt    			  | I | 	 	    sample txt|
| sample txt    			  | I | 	 	    sample txt|

Sample text

### Function/method x implementing `Top-10 swe_news`:
```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		return a
	else:
		return b
```
### Function/method x implementing `Top-10 life_of_biran`:
```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		return a
	else:
		return b
```
### Function/method x implementing `search()`:
```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		return a
	else:
		return b
```
### Function/method x implementing `add()`:
```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		return a
	else:
		return b
```

## Part 2: Implementing data structures
<!-- - Give a brief presentation of the given requirements -->
<!-- - For the hash based word set (HashSet), present (and explain in words): -->
<!-- Python code for function ``add``, how to compute the hash value, and rehashing. -->
<!-- Point out and explain any differences from the given results in ``hash_main.py`` -->

<!-- - For the BST based map (BstMap), present (and explain in words): -->
<!-- Python code for the two functions ``put`` and ``max_depth``. -->
<!-- Point out and explain any differences from the given results in ``bst_main.py``. -->

## Part 3: Count unique words 2
<!-- - How did you implement the Top-10 part of the problem. Feel free to show code fragments. -->
<!-- - Present a unique word count and the Top-10 lists for each of the two files. -->
<!-- What is the bucket list size, max bucket size and zero bucket ratio for HashSet, and the total node count, max depth and leaf count for BstMap, after having added all the words in the two large word files? (Hence, eight different numbers.) -->
<!-- Explain how max bucket size and zero bucket ratio can be used to evaluate the quality of your hash function in HashSet. What are optimal/reasonable/poor values in both cases? -->
<!-- Explain how max depth and leaf count can be used to evaluate the efficiency of the BstMap. What are optimal/reasonable/poor values in both cases? -->

## Project conclusions and lessons learned
<!-- We separate technical issues from project related issues. -->

## Problems and soulutions
whilst working on the sec part of part one (Aquring the top 10 most frequently used word), I had a problem with how I made the dictinonary. I unknowingly made it so I for each word went through the whole file so it made it take (n * n) operations. This made it so for smaller files it worked no problem but for the "swe_news" which has over 15 million took many minutes to solve (never saw the output).
This got solved by making it so for each word I once again count its nr of occurences but also remove said word from the list/file im reading from. 

Then when working on BNS I couldnt make my Node.put() call itself it keept saying undefined or calling the already provided put function with the same name.

## Technical issues 
<!-- - What were the major technical challanges as you see it? What parts were the hardest and most time consuming? -->
<!-- - What lessons have you learned? What should you have done differently if you now were facing a similar problem. -->
<!-- - How could the results be improved if you were given a bit more time to complete the task. -->

sample text

<br>

## Project issues
<!-- - Describe how your team organized the work. How did you communicate? How often did you communicate? -->
<!-- - For each individual team member:  -->
<!-- Describe which parts (or subtasks) of the project they were responsible for. Consider writing the report as a separate task. Try to identify main contributors and co-contributors. -->
<!-- Estimate hours spend each week (on average) -->
<!-- - What lessons have you learned? What should you have done differently if you now were facing a similar project. -->

## Conclusion
I have gained more insight into how BST (Binary Search Trees) and Hash... work aswell as ofcourse how to implement them.
